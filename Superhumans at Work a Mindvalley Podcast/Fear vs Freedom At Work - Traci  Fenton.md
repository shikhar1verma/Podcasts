### To be free

* To be free you have to know what you want to be free from.
* Ask yourself what is constricting you? 
* Then visualise to be in that situation and feel your fears.
* Is it someone's opinion or someone's jugdement you are afraid of or it is something you can't explain but its there.
* Then visualise if that fear is not there then how you feel and react.
* Then take that decision as it is and voila you just got free from your fear only.
* Repeat this at every possible time when you feel constricted, the weird feeling around your heart, above your tummy.

### Self worth

* Just ask yourself how much will you give yourself on 1-10 on self worth.
* Before replying to it, let me give you a quick definition: *It is a feeling that you have good qualities and have achieved good things, respect for or a favourable opinion of oneself.*
* And openely talk about why you seriously give yourself that rating.
* It all about honesty, just be fully honest with yourself.
* After a brainstorm session with yourself, just remember how you can improve on that, how you can do deepwork to know yourself, that it is your right to be in positive environment and create  a positive environement around you.
* Major point she shared was that your are a ten not a nine not a eight or a five but a ten.
* Just  listen to her, she has an amazing voice, just by listening to her you feel a positive enery in you head.
