### Goal setting

* There are three question you should ask before setting a goal.
  * Are you making a right goal for you?
  * Do have the guts to complete that goal? Can you invest your time and energy in completing that goal?
  * How you feel if you completed you goal? Do you feel statisfied?
* Remember, in life, everything is about tradeoff, you can't invest in something, without removing your energy from something else.
* If your goal is very hard for you then completing it 70-80% should make you proud. That you are a doer not a weeper.
* Remove every distractions to acheive your goal.
* May have multiple goals like weekly, monthly, quartly or yearly. But be cautious it should be realistic enough to be completed in given timeframe.
* Believe in yourself that there is nothing you can't do.
* Everything can be acheived if done with whole concentration and focus.
